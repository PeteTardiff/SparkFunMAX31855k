[*SEN-13266*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13266)

The MAX31855K IC takes a standard k-type thermocouple in one end, digitizes the temperature measured and sends that data out the other end via [SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus).  [The datasheet for the MAX31855K can be found here.](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31855.pdf)
